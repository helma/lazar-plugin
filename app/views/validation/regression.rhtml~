		<code>lazar</code> obtains predictions from the experimental results of compounds with similar structures (<em>neighbors</em>). For differentiated predictions chemical similarities are always determined <em>in respect to the endpoint under investigation</em>. A detailled description and formal definition of the <code>lazar</code> regression algorithm has been published in:

      <li>A. Maunz and C. Helma: Prediction of chemical toxicity with local support vector regression and activity-specific kernels, SAR QSAR Environ. Res., in press </li>
		</ul>

      You can donwload the  source code for <code>lazar</code> (<%= link_to "GNU General Public License", "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html" %>) with <%= link_to 'subversion', 'http://subversion.tigris.org/' %>: <br/>
      <code>svn co <%= @svn_url %></code>    <p/> 

		<h3><a name="ad"></a>Applicability Domain Definition</h3>

				The applicability domain (AD) of the training set is characterized by the confidence index of a prediction (high confidence index: close to the applicability domain of the training set/reliable prediction, low confidence: far from the applicability domain of the trainingset/unreliable prediction). The confidence index considers (i) the similarity and number of neighbors and (ii) contradictory examples within the neighbors. A formal definition can be found in:
		<ul>
      <li>A. Maunz and C. Helma: Prediction of chemical toxicity with local support vector regression and activity-specific kernels, SAR QSAR Environ. Res., in press </li>
		</ul>

The reliability of predictions decreases gradually with increasing distance from the applicability domain (i.e. decreasing confidence index). <a href="#image">Figure 1</a> shows this dependency visually, <a href="#weighted_predictions">Table 1</a> weights true/false predictions with their confidence and provides the best indication of the overall performance of the system.
<p/>
For simplicity we provide also results for an applicability domain definition with a sharp border at a confidence index of <%= @conf_limit %>. These results are summarized in <a href="#ad_predictions">Table 2</a> and indicated by the grey area in <a href="#image">Figure 1</a>. Misclassifications within the applicability domain are summarized in <a href="#misclass">Table 4</a>.
<p/>
The presence of substructures that are unknown to the training set (<em>unknown fragments</em>) is another factor that limits the applicability domain. As the training data cannot provide any information about unknown fragments, their relevance has to be evaluated by an expert user (as a rule of thumb large fragments are of less concern, because all shorter subfragments have been evaluated by the system). For this reason the presence/absence of unknown fragments is not considered in the formal applicability domain definition, but their presence is indicated in <a href="#misclass">Table 4</a>.

				Depicts the dependency of predictive accuracy on the confidence index (i.e. the distance to the applicability domain, see <a href="#ad">Applicability Domain Definition</a>). Fluctuations at the left hand side of the figure are statistical artefacts (small sample sizes) and therefore irrelevant.  <br/>
        The <%= link_to "table of misclassifications", :action => :misclassifications, :id => params[:id] %> shows all misclassified instances within the applicability domain. <p/>

      <h3><a name="interpretation">Mechanistic Interpretation</a></h3>

      <h4>Neighbors</h4>
      <em>Neighbors</em> are compounds that are similar in respect to <%= @module.endpoint.downcase %>. It is likely that compounds with high similarity act by similar mechanisms as the query compound. You can retrieve additional experimental data and literature citations for the neighbors and the query structure by following the "Search PubChem" links on the prediction page.

      <h4>Fragments</h4>
      Activating and deactivating parts of the query compound are highlighted in red and green. Fragments that are unknown (or too infrequent for statistical evaluation are marked in yellow. You can retrieve additional statistical information about the individual fragments by following the "Relevant Fragments" link. Please note that <code>lazar</code> predictions are based on neighbors and not on fragments. Fragments and their statisitical significance are used for the calculation of activity specific similarities.
