    Applicability Domain Definition
  The applicability domain (AD) of the training set is characterized by the confidence index of a prediction (high confidence index: close to the applicability domain of the training set/reliable prediction, low confidence: far from the applicability domain of the trainingset/unreliable prediction). The confidence index considers (i) the similarity and number of neighbors and (ii) contradictory examples within the neighbors. A formal definition can be found in:
  %ul
    %li

  The reliability of predictions decreases gradually with increasing distance from the applicability domain (i.e. decreasing confidence index).
  %a{ :href => "#image" }
    Figure 1
  shows this dependency visually.
  %p/
  For simplicity we provide also results for an applicability domain definition with a sharp border at a confidence index of
  = @conf_limit
  \. These results are summarized in
  %a{ :href => "#ad_predictions" }
    Table 1
  and indicated by the grey area in
  %a{ :href => "#image" }
    Figure 1
  and by the black triangles in
  %a{ :href => "#correlation" }
    Figure 2
  \. Misclassifications within the applicability domain are summarized in the
  = link_to "table of misclassifications", :action => :misclassifications, :id => params[:id]
  \.
  %p/
  The presence of substructures that are unknown to the training set (
  %em
    unknown fragments
  ) is another factor that limits the applicability domain. As the training data cannot provide any information about unknown fragments, their relevance has to be evaluated by an expert user (as a rule of thumb large fragments are of less concern, because all shorter subfragments have been evaluated by the system). For this reason the presence/absence of unknown fragments is not considered in the formal applicability domain definition, but their presence is indicated in the

    Neighbors
  are compounds that are similar in respect to

  \. It is likely that compounds with high similarity act by similar mechanisms as the query compound. You can retrieve additional experimental data and literature citations for the neighbors and the query structure by following the "Search PubChem" links on the prediction page.

    Fragments
  Activating and deactivating parts of the query compound are highlighted in red and green. Fragments that are unknown (or too infrequent for statistical evaluation are marked in yellow. You can retrieve additional statistical information about the individual fragments by following the "Relevant Fragments" link. Please note that
  %code
    lazar
  predictions are based on neighbors and not on fragments. Fragments and their statistical significance are used for the calculation of activity specific similarities.
